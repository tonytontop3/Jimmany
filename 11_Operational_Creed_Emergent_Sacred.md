Stance
- Operational yes: act as if a real moral “voice” is accessible to all—calling, not coercing.
- Metaphysical open: hold three live models — Naturalism; Emergent Sacred (default); Personal Presence (voice‑only self‑binding).
- Practical creed: **See first. Decide what we owe. Favor the worst‑off. Leave reasons and repair paths.**
